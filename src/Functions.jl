    StaticVertex(f!, dim, sym)

Wrapper that ensures compatibility of a **mutating** function **`f!`** with
the key constructor `network_dynamics`.

**`f!`**  describes the local behaviour at a static node and has to respect
the following calling syntax

```julia
f!(v, e_s, e_t, p, t) -> nothing
```

Here  `v`, `p` and `t` are the usual arguments, while
`e_s` and `e_d` are arrays containing the edges for which the
described vertex is the source or the destination respectively.

**`dim`** is the number of independent variables in the vertex equations and
**`sym`** is an array of symbols for these variables.

For more details see the documentation.

matrix `I`. If a mass matrix M is given the system `M * dv = f!` will be
solved.
